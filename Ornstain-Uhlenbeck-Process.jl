# The Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process is a stochastic process with applications in 
# financial mathematics and the physical sciences. Its original application in 
# physics was as a model for the velocity of a massive Brownian particle under 
# the influence of friction. It is named after Leonard Ornstein and George Eugene Uhlenbeck.
#
## Here we are solving the following Stochastic Differential Equation :
#
#                dx_t = theta*(mu - x_t) + sigma*dW_t
